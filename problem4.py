A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

'''
# one possible optimisation: instead of looping from 0 to range, go backwards from range to 0
# however, is 98x100 bigger or 99x99? and 97x100 or 98x99? and so on
# at time of coding I couldn't be bothered figuring out

    result = 0

            for digit in str(number):

                    result = number
